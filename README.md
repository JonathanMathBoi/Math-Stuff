## What are the Jupyter Notebooks?
The Jupyter Notebooks are where I either chug along with an idea I had, or write-up how I think about some topic. You can use the buttons below the title to open the notebooks in either binder or google colab.

## What is the Videos Folder?
The Videos folder is where I write and make my math videos. I use [Manim](https://github.com/3b1b/manim) (the animation engine used by 3blue1brown) to make my math videos.
